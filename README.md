# **Industry_Grade_Project-**

**The aim of the project is to build a Machine Learning
Model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto
insurance claim in the next year.**

# **PROCESS FOLLWED**
**1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):**

**Following tasks has been performed as a part of EDA:**
* Scaling/Normalization
* Fill the missing values
* Feature selection & engineering

**2. Machine Learning Modeling:**

**Following tasks can be performed as a part of Modeling:**
* Start with the basic model but eventually move towards ensemble
* Use Deep Learning with sklearn MLPClassifier and check if the Neural Network
Model is better than traditional models
* Arrival at a model with best f1-score
